    <h3 class="centered">Switching it up: modding my Nintendo Switch</h3>

    <p>A few weeks ago I came across some images of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/images-of-yacht-club-games-real-actual-nintendo-switch-dev-kit.1339529/">Nintendo Switch dev kit</a> online. Whilst dev kits aren't that interesting to the average gamer, one thing struck me about the Switch dev kit: the striking black colour scheme for the joy-cons. If you ask me, this looks way nicer than any other joy-cons that nintendo will sell you. I knew I had to have it.</p>

    <p>I wasn't about to go and buy a dev kit (even though they're quite <a target="_blank" href="https://nintendotoday.com/nintendo-switch-dev-kit-price/">reasonably priced)</a>. So, I started looking for alternatives. The first thing that came across my mind was a skin from a company such as <a target="_blank" href="https://dbrand.com">dbrand</a>, but this was outside of my budget, and I fancied a more 'permanent' solution than a skin.</p>

    <p>Eventually I settled on purchasing a set of replacement joy-con housings from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07Q4SGJDK/">Amazon</a>. There's some really cool designs available, including ones based on NES and SNES controllers, and this gorgeous <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/eXtremeRate-Nintendo-Handheld-Controller-Replacement-Great-Wave/dp/B07M69XZB3/" target="_blank">wave design</a>. But, since I'm boring, I just went for plain black. I didn't need to re-house the main console either, since it's black already.</p>

    <p><b>Let's get modding!</b></p>

    <p>Next, I had to disassemble the controllers. This ain't easy. Nintendo has crammed a bunch of tech into the joy-cons, and internally they're a mess of tiny wires and ribbon cables. I'm no stranger to working with electronics, but this was brain surgery compared to anything I've done before.</p>
